# Hardware-Store-POS

This is a simple point of sales application created in Java and MySQL database for a small Hardware store.

The cashier user will be able to deal with customer orders and printout the bill. 
All the receipts details are then recorded in the database for future references.

The admin user will be able to add new items to the inventory as well as view both the inventory and the bill records.
